%STARTSECTION{"treebrowser_attributes"}%
Place the tag =%<nop>TREEBROWSER{= _parameters_ =}%= immediately before a bulleted or numbered list. The lists can be handcrafted, generated by another Plugin, a =%<nop>TOC%=, or the result of a %SYSTEMWEB%.FormattedSearch. The list will be rendered in a tree-like fashion (similar to the explorer folder list). Whenever a new indentation level is started, the subsequent nodes at this or a lower indentation level are shown as descendents of the preceding node. The following parameters can be used to configure the appearance of the tree:
---++ Parameters
   * The following standard attributes are recognized
     %TABLE{sort="off"}%
| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| ="name"= or%BR% =theme="name"= | Select a rendering theme | none |
| =title= | Required. This text serves as the root of the tree | none |
| =openAll= | If =on=, the tree is shown fully expanded. | =off= |
| =openTo= | Must be an integer. If present, the tree is expanded to the given node, as numbered from the root. | =0= |
| =shared= | Must be a string. If present, the state of the tree is shared across all trees using this string. For example, if the tree is used in the WebLeftBar, the state will hold at all topics with this WebLeftBar. It's basically the name of the JavaScript object representing your tree. | none |
| =uselines= | Set to =false= if you don't want to show lines linking nodes and leafs in the tree | =true= |
| =useplusminus= | Set to =false= if you don't want to show '-' and '+' signs. One can use something like =onclick='javascript: tree.o($index);'= in the tree item to trigger opening/closing of a node. | =true= |
| =noindent= | Set to =true= to show children at the level of their parent. It suppresses children indentation. Enabling =noindent= will disable =uselines= and =useplusminus=. | =false= |
| =nocss= | Set to =true= to prevent inclusion of =dtree.css=. | =false= |
| =closesamelevel= | If =true= only one node within a parent can be expanded at the same time. openAll() and closeAll() functions do not work when this is enabled. | =false= |
| =noroot= | Prevents rendering of the title line. Useful if you don't want to show any title. | =false= |
| =warn= | Text to be displayed if no tree was found. | none |
| =style= | Name of the CSS file to include without the =.css= extension. The CSS file must be attached to this topic. | =dtree= |
| =autotoggle= | Set to =on= will enable node open/close when clicking the node item. Typically used for menu style tree along with =noindent=. | =off= |
| =nodeactions= | Defines node functionality in a comma separated list of HTML event and dTree function. Typically used for menu style tree along with =noindent=. Format: <verbatim><event> <function>[,...]</verbatim> =event= is an HTML event e.g. =onclick=, =ondblclick=, =onmouseover=, =onmouseout=... %BR% =function= is one of the three dTree functions: =open=, =close=, =toggle= | none |
| =popup= | Set to =on= to enable pop-up menu mode. Typically used with =closesamelevel=. See [[%TOPIC%#Pop_up_example][pop-up menu example]]. | =off= |
| =closepopupdelay= | Pop-up mode only. Delay in millisecond before all popup close once the mouse cursor has left the menu structure. | =1000= |
| =popupoffset= | Provides x and y offset from parent node for pop-up menus. Allows for fine tunning of pop-up position. | =0,0= |
| =firstpopupoffset= | Provides x and y offset for first level pop-up menus. Introduce as a workaround for PatternSkin issues. | =0,0= |
| =useopacity= | Used to generate extra =dtreeTransluscentBackground= =div=. Enables popup with translucent background and opaque text. | =off= |
